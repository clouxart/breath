# Breathe Mobile - Debug & Fixes

## âœ… Fixed Issues

### 1. **Touch/Click Issues**

- Added `pointerEvents="none"` to gradient container to prevent blocking touches
- Added proper `zIndex` and `elevation` to header elements
- Settings button and stats are now properly clickable
- Removed wrapper TouchableOpacity that was blocking touches

### 2. **Animations Implemented**

- **Gradient Blobs**: Now animate with smooth floating motion
  - Blob 1: Moves in a figure-8 pattern over 4 seconds
  - Blob 2: Moves in opposite pattern over 3.5 seconds
  - Both blobs use `withRepeat` for continuous animation
- **Breathing Orb**: Proper scale and opacity animations
  - Inhale: Scales to 1.3 with opacity 0.45
  - Exhale: Scales back to 1 with opacity 0.25
  - Smooth easing curves using Bezier curves

### 3. **Z-Index Hierarchy Fixed**

```
- Background gradients: z-index 0 (with pointerEvents="none")
- Main content: z-index 1
- Header elements: z-index 10
- Settings button: z-index 11
```

### 4. **Component Structure**

- BreathingOrb now handles its own touch events
- Proper TouchableOpacity implementation
- Clean separation of concerns
